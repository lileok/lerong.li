>Never mind, I find myself using Ubuntu only for the past couple of weeks...

After one week of trying the Ubuntu 12.04, I still have the following concerns about switching to Ubuntu, mainly about softwares I need to use.

### Tools I miss under Ubuntu  

1. I *desperately* need a good pdf annotator! Something like **Foxit Reader** under Windows 7! After searching and trying, I am still out of luck. As a student, I need to read a lot of papers in pdf file type. At the same time, I definitely want to either highlight or make comments when I am reading.
2. I also want some thing like "**Everything**", which is a file search engine under Windows, in Ubuntu. Everything is so great to use: whenever I want to find a file, I just type the name of files, and then, bang, almost simultaneously I got the file list that contains the letters I just typed in.
3. As a non-native English speaker, when I write things in English, some words I am not sure about the exact spelling. Under Windows, I can use the **Google Pinyin Input**. When I switch to english model by press shift key, after typing three letters, it will give me a list of English vocabularies to choose! And most of time, I can find the one I want. One side effect of this is that I probably will never remember its exact spelling. But it is so helpful! But I guess I can survive without this one.
4. English directory. 

### Things I miss under Windows

1. Of course, the **shell**, or commend line. The cmd in Windows is just aweful and hard to use. 
2. You can use **Git** in Ubuntu for every file folder you want to version control. For example, under Ubuntu, under any file folder, I can open the terminal and type `git init` to get the version control of this file folder. But it is not as easy as this under Windows. Though *Github for Windows* is easy to use.
3. Ubuntu is much much beautiful than Windows...

### Wrap up
Still cannot move to Ubuntu 100%. Any suggestions/help will be more than welcome!
