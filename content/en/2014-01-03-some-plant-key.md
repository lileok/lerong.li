This is a note I made in summer of 2013. Post here as archive.

## Diphasiastrum

Branches appearing flattened, the leaves strongly appressed to stems primarily in one plane or at least squarrish in cross section. 

+ ***Diphasiastrum tristachyum*** Branches appearing somewhat squarrish, rather than broadly flattened; often conspicuously **blue-green in color**; all leaves about the same size; ultimate branches 1-2.2 mm wide.

+  Branches strongly flattened; green; leaves on the flat underside of branches shorter than the other leaves; ultimate branches 1.8-4 mm wide.

   - ***Diphasiastrum complanatum***: Branches with **conspicuous constrictions (narrowings)**; lacking sterile tips on the strobili.

   - ***Diphasiastrum digitatum***: Branches **without conspicuous constrictions**; **sterile tips** present on many strobili.


## White oak group

+ ***Quercus alba***: Glabrous at underside of leaves.

+ ***Quercus macrocarpa***: underside of leaves has pubescence, only one stellera type hairs.

+ ***Quercus bicolor***: underside tomentosa, two types of hairs.

## Red oak group

+ ***Quercus rubra***: the deepest sinuses extending 45-70% of the distance to the midvein; **the petioles and green branchlets sparsely hairy or glabrous when the leaves are just expanding**. Acorns.

+ The petioles and green branchlets densely hairy when the leaves are just expanding. the deepest sinuses extending 65-90% of the distance to the midvein.

    + ***Quercus velutina***: Lower surface of leaves **more or less pubescent**; buds hoary-tomentose; cup scales of acorn silky-pubescent, spreading and squarish at the tip; **lower dead branches not persistent.**

	+ ***Quercus ellipsoidalis***: Lower surface of leaves **glabrous or nearly so**; buds glabrous, lustrous, only slightly angled in cross section; **stubs of dead branches persistent on lower trunk.**

## Poison ivy

+ ***Toxicodendron radicans***: Tall branching shrub often > 2m tall, or vine climbing with aerial roots; **perioles moderately to densely hairy**; leaflets ovate, usually more than 1.5 times as long as wide. 

+ ***Toxicodendron rydbergii***: Low shrubs with few if any branches and usually < 1m tall, not producing aerial roots; **petioles glabrous or sparsely hairy**; leaflet broadly ovate, usually less than 1.5 times as long as wide. 
   
## Osmunda cinnamomea

+ Only Cinnamon fern has the pale tan tufts of wool at the base of the pinnae.
